    "# Python supports all different programming paradigms: Success of Python.\n",
    "# Functional Programming, OOP, Procedural Programming\n",
    "# Procedural Programming: We define functions, we call a function from a function. If you wanna create a software, you will\n",
    "# break down your software into small small parts and those modules small modules will be functions.\n",
    "# Function Programming: It means if you can achieve a certain task implementing functions as our mathematical functions where\n",
    "# you will not manipulate a data which is instead of changing data you will still accomplish a task - one of the ways we can\n",
    "# pass a function to a function. Procedural and Functional we have done with eg lambdas. Now, we'll study OOPs: \n",
    "# When we are working on big SWs/Enterprise Projects you need to think everything in the format of objects. We have functions\n",
    "# but since the start of the tutorials, we were talking about objects such as maybe in some program Sir said: this is an object\n",
    "# integer is an object but then we were skipping that part - what is object and what is it important. So, ultimately if we talk\n",
    "# about programming world - what we try to do is try to solve a real world issue with the help of virtual world solution eg\n",
    "# programming softwares. Now, in real world we all use objects right for eg - If I wanna record a video I need a camera, If I \n",
    "# wanna call someone I need a phone, if you wanna type a code you need a keyboard and a laptop. So, for everything you need an\n",
    "# need an object. So, in the real world everything is an object. Eg persons, if I have a company, if I want some work to be done\n",
    "# of course I need employees and for me every employee is an object. So, an employee object is using a laptop object, so some\n",
    "# employer object needs an AC object.\n",
    "# Now, Every object will have 2 things. Every object will have certain attributes and every object will have certain behaviour.\n",
    "# So, attribute = data or properties. Humans are objects. So, my height is an attribute, my age is one attribute, my name is one\n",
    "# attribute, the company I work for is an attribute. And then comes my behaviour, I'm walking, I'm talking, I'm dancing - all\n",
    "# these are behaviours - so our actions define our behaviour and then we have attributes which we know. In other words, as an\n",
    "# object I know something and as an object I do something. So, I do something based on something which I know - so this is \n",
    "# object. Object will have something where you can store data and an object will have some behaviour and this data which we\n",
    "# normally use those are variables, right - so if we want to store something in an object - we need to define variables. If we\n",
    "# need to define the behaviour we need to use methods = functions - we have done evrything already here we just need to think\n",
    "# in terms of objects. OOPs is not just about different syntax - It's also about the way you think - so now if you wanna\n",
    "# achieve anything in programming - you need to think about objects - so the moment you say you have a complex problem - think\n",

    "# are manufactured, right - so I mean in some factory they have been manufactured. Talk about a phone - eg Motorola J3 - now\n",

    "# have a factory in China which is producing all these phones - but Motorola says it is their phone and we don't say it is China\n",
    "# phone - why? Because Manufacturing is not important, you can manufacture stuff anywhere - what is important is where it has\n",
    "# been designed so this is designed by Motorola - but even if we talk about this phone - this has been designed once and then\n",
    "# they have manufactured multiple times and that design in Programming/OOPs we say Class - so in a class we will write a\n",
